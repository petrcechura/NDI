# SPI Arithmetical unit

Repository for a subject "Design of digital integrated circuits and the language VHDL". The goal was to create a VHDL modul able to communicate via SPI bus, The components takes one packet (-> two frames), checks their validity and in next packet sends addition and multiplication result through independent bus. Component also handles rounding and protection against metastability.

The final component (and documentation) was already evaluated and no other changes will be made.
